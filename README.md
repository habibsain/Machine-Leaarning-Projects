Techniques like Tokenization, Stemming and Lemmatization, Stopword Removal 
are used for preprocessing 

# Iris-Classification-using-decision-tree-classifier-SVC-and-Logistic-Regression

Used Support Vector Classifier, Logistic Regression and Decision Tree Classifier to classify feature vectors into three different classes of Iris

# Diabetes-detection-using-Random-forest-KNN-and-Logistic-regression
## For Random Forest Classifier
The accuracy is 88.0
## For KNN Classifier
The accuracy is 96.0
## For Logistic regression Classifier
The accuracy is 80.0

##KNN is most accurate to classify the dataset among the three
